## Translations

Feel free to add translations for your language to `src/locales`, and send a pull request.
Just make a TS file for the locale and I'll sort the rest. 

Don't be shy, they're basically just JSON! ~~but im forced to make them TS or snowpack will eat my ass~~.
Copy `en-GB.ts` and use that as a template.

As of right now, I have no clue if RTL languages work, but feel free to submit them anyway lol
