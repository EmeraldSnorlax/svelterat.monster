## Translations

Feel free to add translations for your language to `src/locales`, and send a pull request.
Just make a JS file for the locale and I'll sort the rest. Don't be shy, they're basically just JSON! ~~but im forced to make them JS or snowpack will eat my ass~~
As of right now, I have no clue if RTL languages work, but feel free to submit them anyway lol
